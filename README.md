# InkDesk

InkDesk is an experimental, local-first browser productivity suite for focused
DOCX, XLS/XLSX, PPTX, PDF, TXT and EPUB workflows. It is not intended to replace
Microsoft Office, a full PDF editor or a complete publishing system.

## InkDesk v0.20.2.8

Version 0.20.2.8 continues the behavior-neutral **Presentations decomposition**.
PPTX open/save orchestration and local recovery ownership are now isolated from
the main editor entry point.

`apps/presentations/io/file-controller.js` owns imported-source buffers, PPTX
open validation, preservation-mode copy export, new-presentation PPTX export and
download lifecycle. `apps/presentations/io/recovery-controller.js` owns
IndexedDB recovery capture/restore, document recovery keys and recovery manager
state. The visible UI, supported formats and save semantics are intentionally
unchanged.

The stable updater hardening from v0.20.2.7 remains in place: real dry-run,
package SHA identity and incremental checksum handling continue to guard each
refactoring package.

## Refactoring policy

The 0.20.x decomposition remains incremental: finish Presentations in bounded
steps, then PDF → shared UI → Documents/Spreadsheets cleanup. Every extraction
must preserve existing behavioral tests, stay inside the architecture guardrails
and stop immediately if a regression appears.

## Privacy

The selected file is processed in the browser. InkDesk includes no project-run
upload server, account system or analytics service. Saving normally downloads a
new local copy rather than overwriting the source file.

## Run

Open `index.html` directly or serve the directory with a static HTTP server.
Cross-workspace handoff, service workers, browser recovery and installation are
more reliable over HTTP or HTTPS.

## Validate

```bash
npm run validate
npm run audit
npm test
npm run test:browser
npm run test:browser:matrix
```

The normal incremental-update workflow remains Chromium-only for predictable
runtime. `test:browser:matrix` explicitly checks installed Chromium, Firefox and
WebKit engines; unavailable engines are reported as not performed unless strict
matrix mode is requested.

## Status

v0.20.2.8 remains a beta. Real-device validation is still required for critical
workflows, large files, native Safari/iPadOS, Firefox, Edge, download behavior
and installed-PWA behavior.

## License

MIT for InkDesk original code. Bundled third-party components retain their
upstream licenses; see `docs/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.

## PDF.js vendoring during publication

The consolidated source pins `pdfjs-dist` 3.11.174 in `VENDOR_SOURCES.json`.
The publication process retrieves that exact npm package, commits the local
display and worker files, regenerates checksums, and runs strict validation.
The published app does not load PDF.js from a CDN at runtime.
